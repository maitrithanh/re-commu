### **Review Comunity**
## **Description**

This is a community website for reviewing anything and everything. Anyone can post reviews (similar to a social media platform for reviews). Each post needs to be approved because all posts can include affiliate links, donation links, etc. (this ensures that posts are clean and not filled with random links). Additionally, users can rate the reviews to indicate whether they are TRUSTWORTHY or not üòÄ (this helps improve the quality of the community). Users can also exchange comments under the posts.

If posting reviews is free, how will the website be maintained?

- **Method 1:** We will incorporate image advertisements.
- **Method 2:** We will accept sponsored posts, which will appear like regular reviews but will be labeled as advertisements (these ‚Äúadvertisement reviews‚Äù still need approval but will be pushed to the top for better customer reach ‚≠ê).

### **Why Use This Website?**

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
